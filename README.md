# NBA-project
Exploratory analysis of NBA stats

High-level to-do list:
  - Problem analysis and classification
  - Data sourcing
  - Data cleaning
  - Data exploration
  - Feature selection and engineering
  - Model development
  - Model deployment(?) explore this
  - Model evaluation

Data cleaning/exploration to do's:
  - Drop unnecessary columns
  - Add seed #
  - Turn relevant categorical columns into numerical (split out)
  - Add column definitions somewhere
  - Trim data set using minimum values
  - Investigate dropped duplicates. Maybe there is a better way to handle these.
  - Investigate limiting time period for data

Feature selection to-do's:
  - Normalise values(?)
  - MVP Share as dependent variable
  - Add a feature for past MVP wins

Model development to-do's:
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Elastic Net
  - Random Forest
  - AdaBoost
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM)
  - Look at SHAP values

Housekeeping to-do's:
  - Set up github properly and workflow using it (done)
  - Turn webscraper into package
  - Use python best practice on package
